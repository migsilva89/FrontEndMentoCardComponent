# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

This is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Box-Model
- Mobile-first workflow

<br>

### What I learned

This is my first project only with HTML and CSS, all my previous projects were made with TailwindCSS.

I Have learned how to create CSS classes, add fonts and hover status. 

Easy project that I can say it was a challenge cause I am very used to Tailwind classes. 

Tips for improve will be much appreciated.
